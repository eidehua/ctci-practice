Big O chapter in CTCI.

Big O (upper bound), Big Theta (lower bound), and Big Omega (tight bound). Industry uses tight bound to mean big Omega
Best, worst, and expected cases describe the big O time for particular inputs or scenarios.
Big O describes a bound for runtime

Space Complexity
Stack space in recursive calls counts!

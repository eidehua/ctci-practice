/* You are given two 32 bit numbers N and M and two bit positions, i and j
   write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i
   you can assume that the bits j through I have enough space to fit all of M
   Example
   input N = 10000000000, M = 10011, i = 2, j= 6
   output N = 10001001100

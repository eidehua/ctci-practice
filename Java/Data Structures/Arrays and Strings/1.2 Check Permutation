// Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other
// Check if they are same length

// Method 1: Hash Table
// Loop through the first string, and store all character counts into a hash map
// Make sure the second string matches the same counts



// Runtime: O(n) loop through first string + O(n) loop through second string + O(n) verify hash table = O(n)
// Space complexity: O(n) extra space for the hash table

// Method 2:

// Data structure that represents a sequence of nodes.
// Singly linked list: each node points to the next node in the linked list
// Doubly linked list: each node has pointers to the next and the previous nodes

// Node class
  // Do you need a wrapper LinkedList class?
    // What if multiple objects reference the linked list, and then the head of the linked list changes? 
    // Some of those objects may still be pointing to the old head, if we just use a Node class

// Important: Runner technique

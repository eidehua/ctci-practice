Me practicing Cracking the coding interview questions (6th edition)

My Chapters to focus on:
Behavioral Questions: good to read early and know how to respond to them
Big O: important to learn first, and important to keep using it correctly with every problem
Technical Questions: important to learn first and implement while practicing, also good to review before an interview

Order of focus: Main chapters

(Vital) Trees and Graphs: Focus on heaps!! and the invariants they need to hold, and interview twists on what the invariants might be. Focus on Tries, haven't used those. Need some graph review as well.

(Vital) Bit Manipulation: memorize, memorize, memorize! A lot of useful tricks to help solve hard problems.

(Vital) Sorting and searching: learn & use the good sorting and search algos! Pay attention to where they can apply, always always think about it as a way to potentially speed up a solution.

(Vital) Recursion and Dynamic Programming: MEMOIZE!! Try doing a lot of tail recursion, or memorize. Try to make iterative approach, usually better for less stack usage.

(Important) Threads and Locks: do more than just the basic threads and locking. 

(Important) System Design and Scalability: something I should be learning

(Important) C and C++, Java: LEARN the cool/useful/hard stuff of each language! Also templates in C++.

(Useful) Math and Logic Puzzles: more practice

(Useful) Databases: important to MEMORIZE the basic general SQL commands. 

(Useful) Arrays and Strings: Definitely know Hash Tables!!! StringBuilder also useful

(Useful) Object Oriented Design: worth a read, and some practice

(less useful) Linked list: know the runner technique, otherwise just make sure to write out the linked list algo pictorally so you can visually confirm it works.

(less useful) Stack and queues: basic review, basic practice

(less useful) Testing: test stuff. Unit tests, etc...

Order of focus: Other chapters:
(vital) hard problems
(important) advanced topics
(important) code library
(important) moderate problems
